In order to play the game dowload the whole folder and click on AlienWarsHTML5 Then HTML5, after that click on click me.html to run game

You Can also use the .exe version in WindowsNotEditor, however your coumputer will say it is a virus but I insure you it is not and if you stil fell uncomfortable than use the HTML5 version.
